            <p>Hello, My name is Takahiro Morita.</p>
            <p>I am an industrial engineer who found my true passion in programming. While working as a SEO specialist in Thailand, I taught myself coding by joining online courses.
            Currently I am at Code Chrysalis creating full-stack applications with technologies such as React, Node.js, Knex, Postgres and Heroku. At present, I am building an Android service using Kotlin.</p>
            <p>During my off time, I like to read books about topics I am curious in such as the mechanism of mobile phone and the history of cipher. And, also exploring new technologies with Arduino to build small IoT service with JavaScript.</p>
